    <h2>A Message from Senior Pastor Gabriel Lujan</strong></h2>
        <p>
In today's society, we are all too aware of the crime known as Identity Theft. Whether shopping online, using a credit card to pay for a meal at a restaurant, or even receiving a financial statement in the mail, we find ourselves vulnerable to crooks looking for access to our personal information. Once they have it in their grasp, these crooks, under the appearance of you, open up bank accounts, apply for credit cards, and make purchases, leaving you holding the bag so to speak. The effects of this are devastating, and it can take several years for you to clear your name, remove the unmerited debt, and restore your credit. In much the same way -- and even more concerning -- is that followers of Jesus Christ have had their spiritual identity stolen and are convinced that they are less than who God has declared them to be in Jesus Christ. 
</p>
<p>
As Christians, we must be aware of Spiritual Identity Theft and that it’s on the rise, and too often we don't even know that it’s happening. In fact, most people live in a constant state of crisis – “spiritual identity crisis”. Our adversary enjoys gathering personal information about us. Once our identity is successfully "stolen," we become filled with doubt and confusion, questioning who we are. The end result is spiritual blindness to the joy, peace and blessings that comes with knowing Christ as our Lord and Savior.  Because of our lack of spiritual knowledge, we are left vulnerable, broken and susceptible to further deceptions.  It’s time to get our identity back, to stake our claim on what God -- not our enemy -- says about us.
</p>
<p>
There are scriptures in the bible that Christ has shown me during my walk with him to bring to remembrance my identity in him, and give me assurance of my place by his side. I encourage you, brothers and sisters in Christ, as I caution myself, to remember who you are, and rejoice daily in the security of your identity in Jesus Christ our Lord.
</p>
<p> 
May God bless you.

<h2>A Message from Executive Pastor Juan Pedro Valencia
</h2>
<p>

In the Old Testament book of Joshua, the children of Israel moved into the Promised Land. They were getting ready to set up their homes as permanent places rather than tents that would be taken down and moved every few days. The leader, Joshua, issued a strong challenge to the families. He said in Joshua 24:15, “But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord. 
</p>
<p>
As a parent, it we need to teach our children to serve our Lord and prepare them for their future. We want them to be strong and we build them according to the knowledge that we acquired in our experiences in life. Those human strategy and disciplines are not bad. However we have to realize that God is the real owner of our children. He is the real builder of our family. We must acknowledge Him as the real head of our family and we must build our family according to His Word. All our effort will be a failure in the end unless we recognize God as the real head in our family.
</p>
<p>
In the time of advance technology and information, the access of our children to bad influences and polluting information is almost impossible to avoid. All of us specially our children are vulnerable to the attack of bad influence and protection of our family is becoming harder to accomplish.  This is the right time to admit our own limitation and ask the help from the real protector of our family no other than God. We cannot watch and protect our family 24/7. Only the omnipresent and all power God is able to do this impossible job of protecting our family.
</p>
<p>
If God is the foundation of a strong family, then we should build our family on Jesus, and serve him as a family.
</p>
<p>
					May God bless you.

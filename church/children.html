For 2 and 3 year olds and the Preschool Spot for 4 year olds up until they go to kindergarten. Your child will experience large group for lessons and worship, and small group for snack, craft and fun with their friends.
</p>
<p>
When a kid transitions into middle school, we want that child to have experienced and own three basic truths modeled by Jesus in Luke 2:52 And Jesus increased in wisdom (in broad and full understanding) and in stature and years, and in favor with God and man.
</p>

<p><strong>
I need to make the wise choice.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I can trust God no matter what.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
I should treat others the way I want to be treated.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Preteens are in a state of transition. Jesus Lives Christian Church is a place where they can prepare for their move from elementary school into the new world of jr. high. Your child will strengthen their faith learning why they believe what they believe and why it matters. They will enter jr. high with a firm foundation and identity where they can live such good lives that others will glorify God.
</p>
<p>
Come bring your children to Jesus Lives Christian Church to explore the Stories of God so they can discover the Character of God with themes such as Knowledge, Creativity, Gratitude, Generosity, Identity, Self Control and Honor plus a whole lot more.

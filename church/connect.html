When walking into a general store normally individuals have one of two responses. There are those precious few who walk in, look around at all of the building materials and somehow automatically know how to place together everything and build something wonderful. What a fantastic gift those individuals have! Most individuals walk into the store, look around and see all of the great tools  that can make great things, but need guidance on how to make it all come together.<br />

The same can be said of how we grow in our relationship with God. There are a few who have this gift to somehow instinctively know how to grow in their faith and their relationship with God from the moment they begin to believe. What a precious gift. Most individuals fall into a second category needing guidance and encouragement.
"Therefore encourage one another and build each other up." - 1 Thessalonians 5:11<br />

One of our goals as a church family is to grow together in our faith and relationship with God. There are many ways to accomplish that goal. We have highlighted a few of those on this website. We encourage you to explore the links and check out a few of the options. If you still have questions after exploring the links, please do not hesitate to call or email one of our ministers.

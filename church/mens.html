Colossians 1:28: so that we shall present every person perfect [or, complete] in Christ Jesus,
</p>
<p>
<strong>What does it mean to be "complete in Christ" as a man?</strong>
</p> 
<p>
As men, we play many important roles, which involve many relationships such as husbands, fathers, providers, spiritual leaders of our homes, co-workers, etc. These relationships can only fulfill their potential as we become more Christ-like in our attitudes and actions. 
</p>
<p>
To accomplish the purpose of being made "complete in Christ," we believe that it is necessary to provide opportunities for men to interact with one another, both on a social basis and also on a spiritual basis. 
</p>
<p>
In Proverbs 27:17 we are told, "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another." 
The mission of the men's ministry is to build men of integrity who choose to do what is right and live a life worthy of their calling. We are all about building men who make a difference and influence the world through service and leadership. At the same time, we strive to grow in friendship, strengthen our families and deepen our faith.

<h2>Statements of Faith</h2>
<p>
He was eternally preexistent with the Father and the Holy Spirit, the Holy Trinity; He became incarnated as the virgin born Savior of the world; that by His sinless life, atoning death on the Cross and through His bodily resurrection He completed God's sole plan for the redemption of fallen humanity.
</p>
<h2>These truths are revealed in the Holy Bible</h2>
<p>
Which is the Holy Spirit inspired and infallible Word of God contained in the books of the Old and New Testament, inerrant as given in their original form; that the Word is the conclusive and final authority provided to humankind, revealing the ultimate Way, the Truth, and the Life â€“ Who alone can satisfy our need and hunger.
</p>
<h2>Verse of the day</h2>
<p>
 Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and a thank offering and into His courts with praise! Be thankful and say so to Him, bless and affectionately praise His name! For the Lord is good; His mercy and loving-kindness are everlasting, His faithfulness and truth endure to all generations.Psalms 100:4-5

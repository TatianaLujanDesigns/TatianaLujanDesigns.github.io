        <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">Home Decor is an app that I have created to help homeowners new and old redecorate their house and make it easy for them. They will be able to see how the new decoration will look on the area they are trying to decorate. They will do this by being able to capture the image and pick the item.
Simple design to keep it easy to navigate.
